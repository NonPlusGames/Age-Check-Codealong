# You will be coding an age check program.
# The program should do all of the following:
#  - Ask the user for their age
#  - Store that age in a variable
#  - Print out whether or not they are old enough to vote
# -  Stretch - Check whether or not they are old enough to drive, rent a car, or get a senior discount

# Ask and store age into a variable using input()


# Check if they are old enough to vote using if/else


    # If they are, print "You are old enough to vote!"


    # If they are not, print "You are not old enough to vote!"


# Stretch Challenges
